= "User requirements"/Purpose

The purpose is to provide a platform for experimenting with algorithms for take-off, landing, and stabilising (initially) quadcopters. Later, the board should be sufficiently flexible to either expand to other flight form factors or investigate more complex algorithms. However, due to the range of different form factors for flying vehicles, we will not explicitly design this functionality in the first version -- just keep an eye on the bigger picture.

The CPU should have sufficient processing power for basic algorithms and an FPGA co-processor will provide flexibility for custom high-performance algorithms not suited to the CPU.

The camera input is intended to capture first-person images from the flight and send them back to the base. However, it is anticipated that the images may also be used in the flight algorithms (obstacle detection, tracking, etc.) and the associated image-processing algorithms may be suited for FPGA implementation.

The board should contain battery and power management, should be chargeable using USB-C, and should provide drive/control circuitry for up to four motors and up to four flight control surfaces. Flight control surfaces are not necessary for the quadcopter, but including them would enable the unit to be repurposed to control fixed-wing vehicles without too much additional effort.

Only three-phase brush-less sensor-less motors will be used in the first version of the board. These are more efficient and more robust than the brushed alternative, and sensor-less operation is sufficient given the high speed of the motors.

The board should contain location/motion sensors for providing closed-loop input to the flight control algorithms, and any other purposes.

There should be support WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity for basic control, and should support extending for RF-based remote control. This anticipates initial experiments mainly targeting the closed loop control algorithms, having minimal external input (likely over a short range, in a WiFi environment). Full flight testing (involving longer range communication) is a second step.

SPI/I2C/UART and general GPIO connections should be available for interfacing additional modules to the flight controller later, to make the platform adaptable as requirements change.

= Quadcopter Design

The quadcopter design used as the basis for the flight controller design is described here. The design is based on the methodology outlined in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCouTFibtPc[this video]. Swapped out the frame due to availability.

The maximum weight for this design will be 250 g. Note that the drone will have a camera, so it still https://aircamdrone.co.uk/drones-under-250g-what-are-the-rules/[requires registration]  (see also https://www.caa.co.uk/drones/rules-and-categories-of-drone-flying/introduction-to-drone-flying-and-the-uk-rules/[here]). The primary reason for this weight restriction is to reduce size/complexity for the development prototype.

The fixed components of the design are as follows:

= Overall Architecture

This design combines the responsibilities normally assigned to separate flight controller board, an electronic speed controller, and a power supply board. The intention is that the result is easy to use and can form the basis for a simple quadcopter design.

== Main MCU

A top-level decision is whether to use the same MCU for both the main microcontroller (flight controller) and the motor control (the ESC), or whether to offload the motor control to a second MCU. The advantage of the former option is simplicity, but disadvantages include finding MCUs with sufficient processing capability and PWM peripherals in the same package.

If multiple MCUs are used, it would be easier if they are from one provider to simplify the software toolchain requirements. As a result, the comparisons below are arranged by manufacturer.

=== STMicroelectronics

This microcontroller is a good option for an all-in-one MCU (including motor control), because it is a dual core device (the Cortex M7 could be used as the main MCU with the Cortex M4 being used for motor control). Only 2 "advanced motor control timers" are available, but it may be possible to manually achieve the required motor and servo control using the other timers.

The advantage of the motor control timers is having 6 channels (with programmable dead-time) for driving the motor stage. The general-purpose timers only have four channels, making them less convenient for three-phase control. However, it is possible to synchronise the timers together.

In the STM32H747xI/G series, there are 10 of these general purpose timers, so 5 pairs of 8 channel PWM outputs (provided they can be synchronised appropriately). 

An alternative is the STM32G474 lines, having 3 advanced motor control timers, and one high resolution timer which looks like it might be usable as a motor controller. In this case, it would still be necessary to program two types of peripheral to drive the motors.

=== Microchip

Microchip has a strong range of motor control products (see  https://www.microchip.com/en-us/solutions/technologies/motor-control-and-drive[here] for a table, and https://www.microchip.com/en-us/solutions/technologies/motor-control-and-drive/motor-control-products/32-bit-microcontrollers-for-motor-control-applications[here] for an overview of the SAM/32-bit products). However, the high-performance MCUs listed here are limited to two motor control peripherals.

=== Renesas

=== ESP32

The https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4/esp32/hw-reference/chip-series-comparison.html[chip comparison] shows that the ESP32 series (no suffix, 2016) contains two motor-control PWMs (MCPWM) and 16 channels of LED PWM. It is not
