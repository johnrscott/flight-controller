= "User requirements"/Purpose

The purpose is to provide a platform for experimenting with algorithms for take-off, landing, and stabilising (initially) quadcopters. Later, the board should be sufficiently flexible to either expand to other flight form factors or investigate more complex algorithms. However, due to the range of different form factors for flying vehicles, we will not explicitly design this functionality in the first version -- just keep an eye on the bigger picture.

The CPU should have sufficient processing power for basic algorithms and an FPGA co-processor will provide flexibility for custom high-performance algorithms not suited to the CPU.

The camera input is intended to capture first-person images from the flight and send them back to the base. However, it is anticipated that the images may also be used in the flight algorithms (obstacle detection, tracking, etc.) and the associated image-processing algorithms may be suited for FPGA implementation.

The board should contain battery and power management, should be chargeable using USB-C, and should provide drive/control circuitry for up to four motors and up to four flight control surfaces. Flight control surfaces are not necessary for the quadcopter, but including them would enable the unit to be repurposed to control fixed-wing vehicles without too much additional effort.

Only three-phase brush-less sensor-less motors will be used in the first version of the board. These are more efficient and more robust than the brushed alternative, and sensor-less operation is sufficient given the high speed of the motors.

The board should contain location/motion sensors for providing closed-loop input to the flight control algorithms, and any other purposes.

There should be support WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity for basic control, and should support extending for RF-based remote control. This anticipates initial experiments mainly targeting the closed loop control algorithms, having minimal external input (likely over a short range, in a WiFi environment). Full flight testing (involving longer range communication) is a second step.

SPI/I2C/UART and general GPIO connections should be available for interfacing additional modules to the flight controller later, to make the platform adaptable as requirements change.

== Planned Prototypes

The board will be developed in two stages:

* *Rev 1.0* will contain the MCU, FPGA, motion/direction/altitude sensors, motor control, power management, and WiFi/Bluetooth. The primary purpose of this development board is to provide a platform to begin work on the core motion control algorithms in a "ground-testing" stage, where long-range remote control is not required. Wireless short-range control will be achieved using either WiFi or Bluetooth, which may also include streaming video off the device.
* *Rev 2.0* will add on the long-range radio components of the design, including GPS sensing, receiving remote control, transmitting telemetry and video (VTX).

The rationale for splitting the development into these two versions is to get a board focusing on motion control up and running quickly, without requiring that all the radio elements are designed simultaneously. Once the core flight controller mechanism is working, this will form a concrete basis for specifying the radio requirements of the board. Radio-related components can then be handled together so that compatibility of multiple radios, interference, range, etc. can be assessed.

= Quadcopter Design

The quadcopter design used as the basis for the flight controller design is described here. The design is based on the methodology outlined in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCouTFibtPc[this video]. Swapped out the frame due to availability.

The maximum weight for this design will be 250 g. Note that the drone will have a camera, so it still https://aircamdrone.co.uk/drones-under-250g-what-are-the-rules/[requires registration]  (see also https://www.caa.co.uk/drones/rules-and-categories-of-drone-flying/introduction-to-drone-flying-and-the-uk-rules/[here]). The primary reason for this weight restriction is to reduce size/complexity for the development prototype.

The fixed components of the design are as follows:

= Architecture Components

This section contains an overview of the options for each of the subsystem components (e.g. sensors, MCU, motors, etc.)

== Motion, Direction and Altitude Sensors

A range of sensors measure motion and location for the purposes of using in flight control algorithms. Requirements for sensor chips include availability for PCBA and at parts suppliers, documentation, and connection to both I2C and SPI (to keep interface options open), and ideally reference to drone applications.

Translational and rotational acceleration are measured using an accelerometer and gyroscope. An example chip containing both functionality is the https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/motion-sensors/imus/bmi270/[BMI270], which is used in the https://betafpv.com/products/toothpick-f405-2-4s-aio-brushless-flight-controller-20a-blheli_32-v4[Toothpick F405 2-4S AIO]. It has 16-bit accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope measurements, and connects via SPI or I2C.

Altitude is measured by measuring absolute atmospheric pressure. A suitable sensor is the https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/pressure-sensors/bmp388/[BMP388], with a pressure range 300hPa to 1250hPa. (One atmosphere is 1013 hPa at sea level, and about 950 hPa at 500 ft.) Although this part is not recommended for new designs (it is replaced by the https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/environmental-sensors/pressure-sensors/bmp390/[BMP390]), the BMP388 is significantly cheaper and more available on JLCPCB PCBA, so is worth considering as a design option in the immediate term, with a view to migrating later. Both SPI and I2C are supported.

The https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/motion-sensors/magnetometers/bmm150/[BMM150] is a magnetic sensor that functions as a 3-axis compass. Similarly to above, it has been superseded by the https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/motion-sensors/magnetometers/bmm350/[BMM350], but that part is not yet available on JLCPCB. Both SPI and I2C are supported.

A chip support all sensors in one package is the https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lsm9ds1.html[LSM9DS1] (also marked as obsolete, but is available from JLCPCB for PCBA). The function is similar to the chips listed above, however, the part is marked as no longer manufactured from Farnell, and therefore will not be considered.

== GPS

The umbrella term for GPS is GNSS (global navigation satellite system), and this terminology is often used on receiver modules. 

== Main MCU

A top-level decision is whether to use the same MCU for both the main microcontroller (flight controller) and the motor control (the ESC), or whether to offload the motor control to a second MCU. The advantage of the former option is simplicity, but disadvantages include finding MCUs with sufficient processing capability and PWM peripherals in the same package.

If multiple MCUs are used, it would be easier if they are from one provider to simplify the software toolchain requirements. As a result, the comparisons below are arranged by manufacturer.

=== STMicroelectronics

This microcontroller is a good option for an all-in-one MCU (including motor control), because it is a dual core device (the Cortex M7 could be used as the main MCU with the Cortex M4 being used for motor control). Only 2 "advanced motor control timers" are available, but it may be possible to manually achieve the required motor and servo control using the other timers.

The advantage of the motor control timers is having 6 channels (with programmable dead-time) for driving the motor stage. The general-purpose timers only have four channels, making them less convenient for three-phase control. However, it is possible to synchronise the timers together.

In the STM32H747xI/G series, there are 10 of these general purpose timers, so 5 pairs of 8 channel PWM outputs (provided they can be synchronised appropriately). 

An alternative is the STM32G474 lines, having 3 advanced motor control timers, and one high resolution timer which looks like it might be usable as a motor controller. In this case, it would still be necessary to program two types of peripheral to drive the motors.

=== Microchip

Microchip has a strong range of motor control products (see  https://www.microchip.com/en-us/solutions/technologies/motor-control-and-drive[here] for a table, and https://www.microchip.com/en-us/solutions/technologies/motor-control-and-drive/motor-control-products/32-bit-microcontrollers-for-motor-control-applications[here] for an overview of the SAM/32-bit products). However, the high-performance MCUs listed here are limited to two motor control peripherals.

=== Renesas

https://www.renesas.com/us/en/blogs/controlling-multiple-motors-single-mcu-example-4-motor-control-rx72t[This article] describes driving four brushless motors using the https://www.renesas.com/us/en/products/microcontrollers-microprocessors/rx-32-bit-performance-efficiency-mcus/rx72t-32-bit-high-performance-200-mhz-operation-microcontroller-optimized-motor-control-industrial-home[RX72T] MCU. 

=== ESP32

The https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4/esp32/hw-reference/chip-series-comparison.html[chip comparison] shows that the ESP32 series (no suffix, 2016) contains two motor-control PWMs (MCPWM) and 16 channels of LED PWM. It is not
