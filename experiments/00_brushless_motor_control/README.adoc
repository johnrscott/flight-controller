= Brushless DC Motor Control using STM32F746

:stem: latexmath
:toc:

This experiment is intended to establish whether PWM from general-purpose timers can control multiple BLDC motors. The results should decide whether it is feasible to perform all the motor control logic in a single MCU such as the STM32H747, which only has 2 advanced motor control timers, but has 10 general purpose timers. The advantages of using a single MCU is board simplicity, lower cost, and lower programming and flashing complexity. The disadvantage is any specific deficiencies with using general timers for three-phase PWM, and CPU conflict/contention running multiple motors on one CPU (this seems unlikely given how "slow" the motor control is, but it is worth checking), or any other issues identified in this experiment.

The intention is create simple breadboard-based hardware to drive the T-Motor P1604 3800KV motor. The electronic design of the motor driver (i.e. the three phase alternator) can be optimised later; the main intention of this experiment is to test the feasibility of the software.

== Background

This section contains a review of the motor control theory required for this experiment. A good starting point for understanding how to drive brushless DC (BLDC) motors is  xref:../../reference/appnote-brushless-dc-motor-control-made-easy.pdf[this Microchip application note], which contains simple explanations of the basic commutation sequence in Figure 1, and describes open-loop control. A more detailed walk through of the ADC requirements and algorithms required to drive BLDC motors is presented xref:../../reference/appnote-sensorless-trapezoidal-control-of-bldc-motors.pdf[this TI application note].

T-Motor P1604 3800KV is a three phase BLDC motor, meaning it is driven by three separate wires (the phases) joined at a common point (a star topology). As described in the Microchip application note (Figure 1), current is driven in six stages called commutation steps, where current is driven into one phase and out another, and one phase is left floating. One electrical revolution means six of these steps performed in sequence.

A simple BLDC motor has 3 phases and 2 poles, and produces one mechanical revolution per electrical revolution. The T-Motor P1604 3800KV is a 12N 14P (14 pole) configuration, and having 7 times as many poles means there are 7 mechanical revolutions per electrical revolution (see https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/596083[here]).

The 3800 KV of the motor shows how to translate voltage into RPM (unloaded): stem:[RPM = V \times K_v]. Since the maximum voltage of the motor is 16.5 V, the maximum RPM is 62700. That corresponds to 1045 mechanical revolutions per second (957 us/rotation), meaning 7315 electrical revolutions per second (137 us/revolution), and 43890 electrical commutations per second (meaning one every 22.8 us). This is the absolute maximum speed of the motor, and defines the upper speed limit requirement of the software system.

The essential requirement for sensorless motor control is the use of ADCs to sense the back EMF induced by the rotating motor, on the floating phase (the one not sourcing or sinking current). Following the TI application note, let stem:[V_a], stem:[V_b] and stem:[V_c] denote the voltages measured by the ADC at the three phases.

NOTE: A voltage divider is used to step down the phase line voltages from 16.5V to 3.3V, for the MCU. This requires a divider such as 10k on the high side and 2k2 on the low side (this will step 16.5V down to just under 3V). A capacitor in parallel with the output will low-pass filter the PWM frequency component, with a value in the range nF or less (detailed calculation below with PWM frequency calculation).

A good application note that explains one sensorless BLDC motor control algorithm in detail is this xref:../../reference/appnote-sensorless-bldc-control-with-back-emf-filtering.pdf[another Microchip application note]

== Experiment 1: Open loop control
 
The intention is create simple breadboard-based hardware to drive the T-Motor P1604 3800KV motor. The electrical design of the motor driver can be optimised later; the main intention of this experiment is to test the feasibility of the software.

The reference for the theory of BLDC motor control is xref:../../reference/appnote-brushless-dc-motor-control.pdf[this Microchip application note], which contains simple explanations of the basic commutation sequence in Figure 1, and describes open-loop control.

=== Hardware setup

Using the https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f746gdiscovery.html[STM32F746-DISCO] board (because I have that lying around) and using xref:../../reference/datasheet-l298.pdf[L298N] dual full-bridge drivers (because I have these in stock).

The following is the list of components required for the hardware setup:

* 1 x T-Motor P1604 3800KV motor (mounted in AOS 3.5 V5 Freestyle Quadcopter Frame for this experiment)
* 1 x STM32F746 DISCO board
* 1 x breadboard
* 2 x L298N dual full-bridge drivers
* 4 x 100nF capacitors
* 6 x LEDs
* 6 x 100k resistors

The breadboard layout for the experiment is shown below 

.Breadboard layout for the experiment
image::breadboard.jpg[]

The design uses one half bridge out of three of the full bridges present across the two L298N chips. Each one of these half bridges drives one phase of the BLDC motor.

Each half bridge driving a phase must be able to drive the phase high, drive it low, and set it floating. To drive it high or low, the corresponding full bridge `ENA`/`ENB` signal must be asserted, and the input `IN1`/`IN3` must be set to high or low.

To set the half bridge to floating, de-assert the `ENA`/`ENB` signal (`IN1`/`IN3` is don't-care).

It is not possible to use the two half bridges from one full bridge independently because `ENA` covers the whole full bridge, but separate control of the half bridges is required.

NOTE: This type of scheme requires six signals: three floating/not-floating inputs, and three high/low inputs (applicable only when non-floating). The alternative scheme is to drive each MOSFET of the three half bridges separately, which still requires six signals. In summary, driving a BLDC requires 6 digital output pins.

The breadboard layout follows the schematic diagram in the datasheet for the L298N. On the input side, an LED is connected to each `EN`/`IN` pin, which is useful to see the commutation signals easily.

The logic signals are powered from the DISCO board at 3V3. The phase power supplies comes from a bench power supply (set to 12V, with a current limit at 2A).

WARNING: The full bridge drivers can only supply a current of 4A, hence the 2A current limit.

This setup does not use sensorless feedback, which involves reading the voltage on the floating signal. The objective here is just feasibility of driving the motors using timer PWM outputs, in open-loop mode.

PWM signals are only needed for the `IN` signals. The `EN` signals can be regular GPIOs because each phase only needs to be floating or not floating during a commutation step.

NOTE: When using the alternative scheme of driving each MOSFET in the three half bridges separately, you still only need three PWM signals, attached to the high-side MOSFETs. This is because the low-side MOSFETs are only used to decide which phases are floating, and which are sinking (and it is not necessary to apply PWM to both the line input and neutral output phases). 

=== Software setup

We will use this opportunity to try using Rust for something non-trivial with the STM32F7 series.

==== Getting basic PWM working

Although it is not clearly stated on the summary page of the STM32F746 datasheet, this MCU does have advanced control timers (TIM1 and TIM8). These timers have four channels, each of which has a positive and a complement pin (used for the high and low side of a half-H bridge). Three of these channels are suitable to drive a three-phase brushless motor.

A very quick test using the minimal project `pwm`, based on https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32f7xx-hal/blob/main/examples/pwm.rs[this example], works on the STM32F746 DISCO board. The relevant lines to configure the PWM in Rust are:

[,rust]
----
// PA8 is pin 3 on CN7 on the Arduino header of the board. It
// corresponds to TIM1_CH1 (the into_alternate followed by passing
// it to the TIM1.pwm_hz() call configures the pin).
//
// PA9 is not mapped to any easily accessible pin on the DISCO board,
// but you can touch an oscilloscope probe on the SB13 bridge to see
// the signal
let gpioa = dp.GPIOA.split();
let channels = (gpioa.pa8.into_alternate(), gpioa.pa9.into_alternate());

let pwm = dp.TIM1.pwm_hz(channels, 20.kHz(), &clocks).split();
let (mut ch1, mut ch2) = pwm;

let max_duty = ch1.get_max_duty();
ch1.set_duty(max_duty / 2);
ch1.enable();

let max_duty = ch2.get_max_duty();
ch2.set_duty(max_duty / 4);
ch2.enable();
----

An immediate problem is the lack of conveniently-mapped pins on the DISCO board.

From the datasheet, the only timer channels with an easily accessible list of possible alternate pins for the 6 channels of TIM1, along with the pin use on the DISCO board, are:

* TIM1_CH1: PE9 (SDRAM use, data), PA8 (accessible pin header)
* TIM1_CH1N: PE8 (SDRAM use, data), PA7 (ETH use), PB13 (USB HS use)

* TIM1_CH2: PE11 (SDRAM use, data), PA9 (VCP_TX, part of ST-LINK circuit, SB13 jumper)
* TIM1_CH2N: TODO

* TIM1_CH3: PE13 (SDRAM use, data), PA10 (ID pin 4 of OTG FS, CN13)
* TIM1_CH3N: TODO

* TIM1_CH4: PE14 (SDRAM use, data), PA11 (DM pin 2 of OTG FS, CN13)
* TIM1_CH4N: TODO

From the data above, it is clear that TIM1 cannot be utilised without (probably) modifying the board (e.g. removing the SDRAM module). The same is true for TIM8, which is equally inaccessible. Testing the advanced timers is therefore out of scope for this first experiment.

The timer channels which are accessible on the headers are as follows:

* TIM12_CH1: PH6, pin7 CN4
* TIM12_CH2: PB15, pin 4 CN7
* TIM1_CH1: PA8, pin 3 CN7
* TIM2_CH1: PA15, pin 2 CN7
* TIM3_CH1: PB4, pin 4 CN4
* TIM5_CH4: PI0 (letter i, number zero), pin 6 CN4

Luckily, there are six timers here (these exhaust all the timers on the Arduino pin headers), so there is a possibility of three-phase motor control if the peripherals can be synchronised appropriately.

A snippet of the basic code required to turn on the channels is shown below:

[,rust]
----
// How to turn on one channel on a timer
// CN4, pin 4
let channels = gpiob.pb4.into_alternate();
let mut ch = dp.TIM3.pwm_hz(channels, 20.kHz(), &clocks).split();
let max_duty = ch.get_max_duty();
ch.set_duty(max_duty / 2);
ch.enable();

// How to turn on multiple channels in a timer
let channels = (gpioh.ph6.into_alternate(), gpiob.pb15.into_alternate());
let pwm = dp.TIM12.pwm_hz(channels, 20.kHz(), &clocks).split();
let (mut ch1 , mut ch2) = pwm;

// CN4, pin 7	
let max_duty = ch1.get_max_duty();
ch1.set_duty(max_duty / 4);
ch1.enable();	

// CN7, pin 4	
let max_duty = ch2.get_max_duty();
ch2.set_duty(max_duty / 7);
ch2.enable();
----

To set up the required three PWM signals and three GPIO signals, the following code snippet can be used:

[,rust]
----
// CN4, pin 4 -- enable_1
let mut enable_1 = gpiob.pb4.into_push_pull_output();
enable_1.set_high();

// CN4, pin 7 -- enable_2
let mut enable_2 = gpioh.ph6.into_push_pull_output();
enable_2.set_high();

// CN7, pin 1 -- enable_3
let mut enable_3 = gpioi.pi2.into_push_pull_output();
enable_3.set_low();

// CN4, pin 6 -- high_side_1
let channels = gpioi.pi0.into_alternate();
let mut high_side_1 = dp.TIM5.pwm_hz(channels, 20.kHz(), &clocks).split();
high_side_1.set_duty(1);
high_side_1.enable();

// CN7, pin 2 -- high_side_2
let channels = gpioa.pa15.into_alternate();
let mut high_side_2 = dp.TIM2.pwm_hz(channels, 20.kHz(), &clocks).split();
high_side_2.set_duty(1);
high_side_2.enable();

// CN7, pin 3 -- high_side_3
let channels = gpioa.pa8.into_alternate();
let mut high_side_3 = dp.TIM1.pwm_hz(channels, 20.kHz(), &clocks).split();
high_side_3.set_duty(1);
high_side_3.enable();
----

The commutation steps are performed as follows:

[,rust]
----
loop {

    // In line 1, out line 2
    enable_1.set_high();
    enable_2.set_high();
    enable_3.set_low();
    high_side_1.set_duty(duty_1);
    high_side_2.set_duty(0);
    high_side_3.set_duty(0);

    delay.delay_ms(comm_delay);

    // In line 3, out line 2
    enable_1.set_low();
    enable_2.set_high();
    enable_3.set_high();
    high_side_1.set_duty(0);
    high_side_2.set_duty(0);
    high_side_3.set_duty(duty_3);

    delay.delay_ms(comm_delay);

    // In line 3, out line 1
    enable_1.set_high();
    enable_2.set_low();
    enable_3.set_high();
    high_side_1.set_duty(0);
    high_side_2.set_duty(0);
    high_side_3.set_duty(duty_3);

    delay.delay_ms(comm_delay);

    // In line 2, out line 1
    enable_1.set_high();
    enable_2.set_high();
    enable_3.set_low();
    high_side_1.set_duty(0);
    high_side_2.set_duty(duty_2);
    high_side_3.set_duty(0);

    delay.delay_ms(comm_delay);

    // In line 2, out line 3
    enable_1.set_low();
    enable_2.set_high();
    enable_3.set_high();
    high_side_1.set_duty(0);
    high_side_2.set_duty(duty_2);
    high_side_3.set_duty(0);

    delay.delay_ms(comm_delay);

    // In line 1, out line 3
    enable_1.set_high();
    enable_2.set_low();
    enable_3.set_high();
    high_side_1.set_duty(duty_1);
    high_side_2.set_duty(0);
    high_side_3.set_duty(0);

    delay.delay_ms(comm_delay);
}
----

=== Results

Using the code in `pwm/`, it is possible to drive the BLDC motor in open-loop mode at 3 ms per commutation step. For the 14N12P motor configuration, which has 7 electrical revolutions per mechanical revolution (so there are 42 commutations in one mechanical rotation), this implies 126 ms per mechanical rotation, or 476 RPM.

To run the code, plug in the DISCO board, install the toolchain as described in the `pwm/README.md`, and run:

[,bash]
----
cargo run
----

== Experiment 2: Back EMF signal measurement

The next step is to incorporate the analog to digital converters required for sensorless closed-loop control of the commutation. 

=== Methods

The program for this experiment is in the `motor-control` folder (commit c9909ea). It is based on the RTIC template in `../02_basic_embedded_rust`. To run it, change to the `motor-control` folder and run:

[,bash]
----
cargo run
----

The program exposes a UART command line interface. Once the program is running, connect to it by running:

[,bash]
----
cu -l /dev/ttyACM0 -s 115200
----

If the prompt `$` does not appear, press enter. There are two commands (you can type `help` to see help documentation):

* `pwm-duty DUTY` sets the duty cycle for the motors, between 0.0 and 1.0.
* `step-time TIME_US` sets the time for a single commutation step, in microseconds.

Using a motor voltage of 5V, the following procedure was found to reliably increase the open-loop motor RPM:

. Set the PWM duty cycle to 0.5, and set the step time to 3000. The PWM level provides sufficient power to get the motor moving at this commutation rate.
. Successively set the step time to 2500, 2000, 1500, 1200, 1000, 900, 800, 700, 650. It is important to keep the change in commutation rate a relatively small proportion of the current rate, otherwise the motor will go out of lock.
. Once the target rate has been achieved (650), step down the PWM duty cycle to 0.4, 0.35, 0.3, 0.25. 0.23 was found to be the minimum PWM duty cycle capable of supporting a step time of 650us. It is important not to reduce the PWM too much while still changing the step time, because then the force required to make a step change in the motor speed is not available.

=== Results

The results below correspond to setting the motor to perform one commutation per 650us, using a motor voltage of 5V with a PWM duty cycle of 0.23. This draws 0.21A as measured on the bench power supply.

NOTE: In the oscilloscope traces, the yellow trace is attached directly to the motor phase corresponding to the CN7 pin 3 signal. The cyan trace is connected to the CN7 pin 3 signal PWM. The pink trace is connected to the CN4 pin 4 PWM signal. 

The figure below shows the back EMF trace on one of the phases, measured using a resistor divider of 10k and 2k2 (in preparation to step down 16V to 3v3). This figure looks quite similar to the diagrams shown in the xref:../../reference/appnote-brushless-dc-motor-control-made-easy.pdf[the Microchip application note (Figure 11)]. The middle portion is where the phase is driven by the cyan signal (the high-side signal). On either side is the back-EMF signal generated by the floating phase.

The next figure shows a zoomed-in version of the leading back-EMF signal (before the phase is driven), showing that the back-EMF voltage is in phase with the PWM signal. The ADC must therefore sample some time in the on period of the PWM, as explained in the application notes.

== Experiment 3: Sensorless control

The next step is to get a working version of the sensorless control algorithm. This involves reading the three motor phase voltages using the ADC peripheral, and using the resulting measurements to determine when to commutate the PWM signals.

In this first experiment, the question of driving four motors using one STM32F7 will not be addressed. The purpose of this initial investigation is to get the algorithms works.

NOTE: Although the STM32F7 series and many STM32 devices contain specific advanced motor control timing peripherals (e.g. TIM1/TIM8 in the STM32F746 device), we will not be using their features. This is because no STM32 device contains more than three of these advanced motor control peripherals, and therefore this approach cannot generalise to a solution where one MCU controls all four motors. If using a single MCU is ruled out and four MCUs become necessary, or if you only need to drive at most three motors, using these advanced peripherals is a better approach.

The main reference for this experiment is xref:../../reference/appnote-sensorless-bldc-control-with-back-emf-filtering.pdf[this Microchip application note], which describes the sensorless algorithm in detail. There are three steps to the control:

* Measure the motor phase voltages at the motor terminals using resistor dividers to bring the voltage within the range of the ADC. During each on-time of whichever PWM signal is currently driving the motor, take a sample of the voltage at _all_ three motor phases (i.e. not just the floating phase).
* Calculate the virtual neutral voltage of the motor, which is the average of the measured voltages: stem:[V_n = (V_a + V_b + V_c) / 3]. Compare the voltage of the floating phase against stem:[V_n] to determine if a back-EMF crossing has occurred. Apply signal processing algorithms (e.g. the majority function algorithm in the application note) to make the calculation of when the crossing occurs more robust.
* Commutate the PWM signals after a delay of 30 electrical degrees following the back-EMF crossing (i.e. half the commutation step time, determined from past step times).

=== Methods

For now, we will use all three ADCs of the STM32F746, one for each phase measurement. The ADC measurements must be synchronised to the PWM cycle starts. This can be achieved by writing `0b01` to `EXTEN[1:0]` (trigger on rising edge), and then setting the trigger source (`EXTSEL[3:0]`) to a timer channel source (whichever timer channel is driving the PWM).

The simplest way to synchronise multiple timers is to treat one as the synchroniser (by writing `001` to the `MMS[2:0]` bits of the `TIMx_CR2` register). This sets this timer to output its enable signal to other timers, causing them to start at the same time (see the description on p. 790 of the reference manual). Synchronised counters are set to use this trigger input to enable them. All counters are set in PWM mode (where `TIMx_ARR` is set to the period, and `TIMx_CCRx` is set to the duty cycle, a proportion of `TIMx_ARR`).

NOTE: A simple way to synchronise PWM signals in the final hardware is to use the channels from the same timer as the PWMs. These share a timer counter and `TIMx_ARR` register, and so are always synchronised (they may have different duty cycles because there are separate `TIMx_CCRx` registers, one per channel).

=== Results

== Conclusions

There will not be a bottleneck due to PWM/timer modules when driving four BLDC motors. Six digital output channels (three PWM and three GPIO) are required per motor, so 24 pins in total. According to the xref:../../reference/appnote-brushless-dc-motor-control.pdf[Microchip application note], only a single ADC is required for motor, so four ADC channels are required in total.

It is highly likely that the STM32H7 series devices contain enough timers, ADCs, and processing speed, to handle the motor driving algorithms in the Cortex M4 core.
